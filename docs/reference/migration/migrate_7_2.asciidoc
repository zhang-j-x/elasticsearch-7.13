[[breaking_72_discovery_changes]]
=== Discovery changes

[discrete]
==== Only a single port may be given for each seed host.

In earlier versions you could include a range of ports in entries in the
`discovery.seed_hosts` list, but {es} used only the first port in the range and
unexpectedly ignored the rest.  For instance if you set `discovery.seed_hosts:
"10.11.12.13:9300-9310"` then {es} would only use `10.11.12.13:9300` for
discovery. Seed host addresses containing port ranges are now rejected.

[discrete]
[[breaking_72_ilm_deprecations]]
=== {ilm-cap} ({ilm-init}) deprecations

[discrete]
[[deprecate-ilm-poll-interval-1s]]
==== An {ilm-init} poll interval of less than one second is deprecated.

Setting `indices.lifecycle.poll_interval` to less than one second (`1s`) is now
deprecated. If the `indices.lifecycle.poll_interval` cluster setting is too low,
it can cause excessive load on a cluster.

To avoid deprecation warnings, use a setting value of `1s` or greater.

[discrete]
[[breaking_72_ingest_changes]]
=== Ingest pipeline changes

[discrete]
[[deprecate-ecs-parameter]]
==== The `user_agent` ingest processor's `ecs` parameter is deprecated.

The `ecs` parameter for the `user_agent` ingest processor is deprecated and will
be removed in 8.0. In 8.x, the `user_agent` ingest processor will only return
{ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)] fields.

To avoid deprecation warnings, remove the parameter from your ingest pipelines.
